## Data Collection
The dataset has been collected from kaggle.com .The JSON file contains a collection of news articles related to various technology topics. Each article in the JSON file has several fields such as "title", "content", "published_date", "author", "source", and "link".
- **title:** The title of the article.
- **content:** The content or main body of the article.
- **published_date:** The date when the article was published (in the format YYYYMMDD).
- **author:** The author or authors of the article.
- **source:** The source or publication where the article was originally published.
- **link:** The URL link to the original article.

## Information Extraction
The relevant information is extracted from each news article, including the title, publication date, author, and content. The text data is then cleaned and preprocessed to enhance its quality for further analysis.

### Extraction Process:
- **Title:** The title of each news article is extracted to provide a concise summary of its content
- **Publication Date:** The publication date indicates when the article was published and is crucial for understanding its temporal context
- **Author:** The author's name is extracted to attribute the article's content to its creator
- **Content:** The main body of the article, which contains the detailed information and analysis, is extracted for further processing.
### Text Preprocessing:
- **Stopwords Removal:** Commonly occurring words such as "the," "is," and "and" are removed from the text data as they do not carry significant meaning for analysis
- **Punctuation Removal:** Punctuation marks such as commas, periods, and exclamation marks are removed to ensure uniformity and consistency in the text
- **Stemming or Lemmatization:** Words are reduced to their base or root form using stemming or lemmatization techniques. This step helps in reducing word variations and standardizing the text for analysis.
The extraction and preprocessing steps ensure that the text data is clean, standardized, and ready for further analysis, such as topic modeling or sentimentÂ analysis.



# LDA Topic Analysis Results

## Optimal Number of Topics
The process of determining the optimal number of topics for LDA topic modeling is based on coherence scores, which helps in generating more interpretable topics from the given text data.

### Analysis of Topics Generated by LDA Model

The LDA model identified 9 distinct topics within the collection of news articles:

#### Topic 0: Software Development and Programming
   - Keywords: code, compiler, project, developer, work, GCC, LLVM, library
   - This topic likely represents discussions related to software development, programming projects, and development tools.

#### Topic 1: Open Source and Community
   - Keywords: year, phoronix, developer, opensource, month
   - This topic suggests discussions about the open-source community, developments over time, and contributions from developers.

#### Topic 2: Operating Systems and Software Distribution
   - Keywords: device, system, software, Red Hat, distribution, firmware, Pi
   - This topic encompasses discussions related to operating systems, software distribution, and firmware updates, possibly focusing on projects like Raspberry Pi.

#### Topic 3: Software Releases and Updates
   - Keywords: release, new, improvement, fix, update, change, feature
   - This topic revolves around discussions about software releases, updates, features, and changes.

#### Topic 4: Linux Distributions and Desktop Environments
   - Keywords: Ubuntu, Fedora, GNOME, release, Wayland, desktop, KDE, package
   - This topic involves discussions about various Linux distributions, desktop environments, and associated package management.

#### Topic 5: Graphics and Display Drivers
   - Keywords: driver, Mesa, graphic, OpenGL, AMD, Radeon, Vulkan, NVIDIA
   - This topic suggests discussions about graphics drivers, OpenGL, Vulkan, and developments in the open-source graphics ecosystem.

#### Topic 6: Gaming and Gaming Platforms
   - Keywords: game, video, Steam, Wine, engine, Valve, Vulkan
   - This topic encompasses discussions about gaming, gaming platforms like Steam, and gaming-related technologies like Vulkan.

#### Topic 7: Performance Testing and Benchmarks
   - Keywords: test, performance, CPU, system, benchmark, ARM, Intel
   - This topic includes discussions about performance testing, benchmarks, CPU performance, and system optimization.

#### Topic 8: Kernel Development and Hardware
   - Keywords: kernel, driver, patch, hardware, Intel, DRM
   - This topic revolves around discussions about kernel development, hardware support, graphics drivers, and patches.

Overall, the LDA model has effectively identified the main themes present in the collection of news articles, covering a wide range of topics related to software development, open-source communities, operating systems, gaming, graphics, and hardware.


## Distribution of Articles Among Topics
The histogram below visualizes the distribution of articles among the identified topics. The x-axis represents the topics, and the y-axis represents the number of documents.

## Word Clouds for Each Topic
A word cloud is a visualization technique used to represent text data, where the size of each word corresponds to its frequency or importance within the text. In the context of topic modeling, word clouds are often generated for each topic to visually showcase the most prominent words associated with that topic.
Larger words in the word cloud represent words that are more frequently mentioned in the topic's documents.
Below are the word cloud visualization of each topic:
